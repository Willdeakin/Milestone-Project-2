## Testing and Bug Fixes


## Deployment

### Project Creation
This project was created in its own repository using Github under my account name. It is named Willdeakin/Milestone-Project-2 and contains all the necessary files to run the website.

I used Gitpod to write and edit these files, using the bash terminal for saving, updating and version control of the project. For the purpose of this project, I used these commands:
- git add -A; to add all files to the staging area
- git commit -m "*message detailing the changes from the last version*"; to commit changes from the staging area to the local repository
- git push; to push committed changes from the local repository to the Github repository

### Using GitHub Pages
- Access the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Willdeakin/Milestone-Project-2/).
- Click the Settings tab in the tabs menu.
- Scroll to the Github Pages section.
- Make sure that the branch selected is main; it should already be selected, if not this should be saved with the button just next to the branch dropdown.
- Click the link on the first line, which should read 'https://willdeakin.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/'

### Run Locally
- Access the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Willdeakin/Milestone-Project-2/).
- Click the Code dropdown.
    - Download the ZIP file, which can be unpackaged and opened with an IDE.
- Or 
    - Copy Git URL (there is a handy clip button next to the URL).
    - Open a development editor and a terminal window within the directory.
    - Use 'git clone' in the terminal followed by the copied URL.
    - You now have a copy of the project in your directory.
